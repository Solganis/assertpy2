"""What the pytest plugin prints, read from a child run of a deliberately red suite.

Every other project here calls the library and checks the answer.  This one checks the half that has no
API: hooks that pytest calls, ini options a consumer sets in their own `pyproject.toml`, and the
worker-to-controller transport under `pytest-xdist`.  All of that is written against pytest's internals
and had been exercised only from the repository, where the plugin's own conftest pins its defaults.

The red suite is written into a temporary directory rather than kept beside this file, so this project's
own run stays green and nothing here has to be excluded from collection.
