"""The parts that are deliberately dynamic, used the way the documentation says to use them.

Matchers are registered at runtime and `add_extension` adds a method that no protocol declares.  Both
are documented holes in the typed surface, so what this project checks is that they still *work*, and
that nothing in the typed part broke reaching them.

`has_*` used to live here too.  It resolves through `__getattr__` on the builder, and a value with no
capability no longer reaches that builder, so the calls are type errors while the runtime answers them
exactly as before.  They moved to `dynamic_only/`, beside the other half no checker can see.
