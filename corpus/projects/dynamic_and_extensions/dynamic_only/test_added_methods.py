"""The half no checker can see, kept apart from the half every checker must accept.

`add_extension` puts a method on the builder at runtime, and the typed surface deliberately does not
know about it: that hole is documented rather than closed.  So these calls live here, excluded from type
checking, and the exclusion is the point being recorded.  What is checked is that they still run.
