"""`has_<attribute>()` on a plain class: it runs, and no checker is told about it.

The typed surface stopped offering it when a value with no capability stopped reaching the full
builder, which is where `__getattr__` lives.  Runtime behaviour did not change, and the documented
migration is to assert on the attribute rather than through it:
`assert_that(account.owner).is_equal_to("alice")`.  Both spellings are exercised here, so the day the
runtime stops answering the first one, this project says so.
