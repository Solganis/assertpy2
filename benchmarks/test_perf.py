# CodSpeed regression gate: micro-benchmarks of assertpy2's hot paths, measured commit-over-commit under

# what the CI job runs.  Not collected by the default suite, so machine noise never gates.
#
# The local "Time (best)" column is not a measurement: 95 us of wall clock was reported as 85 ns and two
# cases came out in the wrong order.  Read `Run time / Iters` instead.
