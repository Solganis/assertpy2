"""Hold the package at full type completeness: every exported symbol has a type a checker can name.

A different question from the one `test_pyright_baseline.py` asks.  That gate reads what pyright says
about the code as it is written, from the inside.  This one reads the exported surface from the
outside: `--verifytypes` walks every symbol the package exports and reports the ones whose type it
cannot resolve to something concrete.  A package can check clean and still hand its users an
`Unknown` on a public method, and until this was written, ours did on 33 of them.

It reads this checkout, not a built wheel, and the two were measured to agree: a wheel built and
installed into a clean environment reports the same 412 exported symbols and the same 100%.  Whether
the wheel *contains* the typed surface at all is `test_typing_from_a_wheel.py`'s question, and
answering it costs a build and an environment, which is why this one does not ask it again.

`Any` is not `Unknown`.  A parameter declared `object` or `Any` is a decision the surface records, and
pyright counts it as known.  What it counts against us is a name with no annotation at all, a generic
left unparameterised, an attribute a subclass reassigns without saying to what.  Those are the ones a
reader cannot recover from the code.

`--ignoreexternal` is load bearing and not cosmetic.  Without it the score is 92.72%, and the 29
symbols it adds are pytest's own partially-typed internals arriving through our plugin hooks:
`TerminalWriter`, `ReprTraceback`, `Config`.  Annotating around somebody else's incomplete surface is
not what this gate is for.

Named rather than scored, for the reason the baseline gate names its overlaps: a score of 99.5% says
nothing about which symbol slipped, and two symbols trading places leave it unmoved.

Skipped where pyright is absent: it lives in the `typecheck` group, so this runs in the type-check job
rather than in the main suite.
