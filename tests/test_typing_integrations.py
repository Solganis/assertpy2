"""Hold what the checkers make of real pandas, polars and numpy values to the recorded matrix.

The overloads narrow on structure, and the structures belong to pandas, polars and numpy.  So the
question this file answers is not whether the overloads are written correctly, which
`tests/test_typing.py` answers against stand-ins on every platform, but whether the libraries still
match them.  Stub drift is silent by construction: a member that stops being declared moves a value to
the generic builder, which type-checks fine and simply stops offering the narrowed methods.

Skipped where the checkers or the libraries are absent, so this runs in the type-check job.
