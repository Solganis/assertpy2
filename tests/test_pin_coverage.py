"""Every view a caller can hold has a pin for each member that changes the type.

Two gates ask about types and they ask different things. `test_typing_completeness.py` asks whether a
checker can *name* a type for each exported symbol, and `test_typing.py` pins that the name is the right
one. A symbol with a named but wrong type passes the first and, until something calls it, is not reached
by the second.

Not every method. Most return `Self`, and a pin on those answers nothing while costing maintenance
forever. The ones worth holding hand back something else, because a pivot returning the wrong view is
silent: the call runs and everything after it is read as a value it is not.

Three things make the set the observable one rather than every declaration:

* the views are resolved from the `assert_that` ladder and closed over what those views return, so a
  protocol nothing hands back is not asked for a pin nothing could write
* a member is taken from the protocol that declares it after MRO resolution, so a base declaration
  every child overrides is not required, and one inherited by seven views is asked for one pin
* a return that is a `TypeVar` is the subject's own type, which a pin necessarily spells concretely, so
  those are matched on the member alone
* a return naming the owner under its own parameters is `Self` by another spelling, which is how the
  capability facade writes it: it stands in for the builder and cannot use `Self`. `_CapableAssertion[_U]`
  from a `_CapableAssertion[_U | None]` receiver is not that, and is asked for a pin

Matched on the member *and* the view it claims, read out of the `assert_type` calls themselves. A member
name alone lets a new pivot ride on the pin for an existing one, and a text search for it matches a
comment.

Every overload return counts, rung by rung. `satisfies`, `is_not_none` and `is_instance_of` each carry
one per view they narrow to, and a rung is an independent mapping from the narrowed type onto the view:
changing one is invisible to a pin on any other.

Rungs returning one view are told apart by what they narrow on, since `satisfies(TypeIs[int])` and
`satisfies(TypeIs[float])` both hand back `_NumericAssertion` and one pin must not answer for both. The
ladders keep that in different places: `satisfies` in a `TypeIs[...]` argument, `is_instance_of` in a
`type[...]` one or in how many classes it is given, `is_not_none`, `eventually` and the pivots of a claimed
value in the protocol `self` is annotated with. A rung keyed on a type variable alone is the catch-all, and
a pin is its witness only where no named rung of the same view takes what the pin narrows on.

A rung with no portable pin is recorded in `_UNPINNABLE` with what refuses it: the badge promises zero
suppressions, so there is nowhere to put a difference between checkers but there.
