"""A failed comparison's diff, held to explaining the failure, and a graph held to reading as the tree it is.

Two laws, asked of `is_equal_to` and of what answers the same question, `match.equal_to` and `check()`.

1. The diff explains the verdict.  A comparison that fails carries a diff with an entry in it.  An entry with
   two sides names a pair that fails on its own under the options that compare values, an entry with one side
   names a value the other side has nothing beside, and under ``ignore=`` no entry lies where the option told
   the comparison not to look.  An entry reached by keys, positions and fields alone leads from the two values
   compared back to the two it holds.

2. A graph is the tree it unfolds into.  Two values that lead back into themselves are compared as the two
   trees their graphs unfold into, cut off below the depth at which two graphs of their size can still differ.
   The expected verdict is not a second implementation of the comparison: it is the library's own answer on the
   trees, which hold no cycle.  Two nodes that can be told apart are told apart within as many steps as there
   are pairs of nodes, so nothing past that depth decides.  Where Python's own ``==`` is what compares, a cycle
   raises `RecursionError` as it does there, and that is the one difference allowed.

The second law holds for options that read a value the same whether it is reached once or again: a comparator
that asks whether its operand holds itself answers differently on a tree by design, and is outside it.
