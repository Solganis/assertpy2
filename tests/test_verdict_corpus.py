"""Hold every recorded answer to what it was at the last release.

A red run here is a decision, not a failure to paper over: read which case moved, decide whether the
change is meant to ship, and re-record with

    ASSERTPY2_UPDATE_VERDICTS=1 pytest tests/test_verdict_corpus.py

The diff of `verdict_golden.txt` is then the draft of the release's Behaviour changes section, which is
the whole point: 2.27.0 shipped one note about a change nobody could see and three real changes that a
hand-built sweep against the previous tag found late.
