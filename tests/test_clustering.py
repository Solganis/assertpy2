"""Grouping a run's failures by the difference they share.

The two halves matter for different reasons. Getting the grouping right is what makes the summary
useful; getting the *non*-grouping right is what keeps it honest, because a diff entry that carries no
coordinate would otherwise put every unrelated failure of its kind under one meaningless heading.

The key is the place rather than the values, which was a correction: an applicability map over eleven
shapes of run showed that keying on values covers a broken constant and nothing else, and misses a
broken formula differing at the same field with a value of its own per test.
