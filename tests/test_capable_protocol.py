"""Hold the façade the capability umbrella hands back to what it is generated from.

`assert_that()` returns this for a value that answers to some capability and to no overload by name.
It used to return the builder itself, which meant every assertion on it, including the six that order
the value: `assert_that(a_mapping).is_positive()` type-checked on ty, mypy and Pyright, the three
gated then, and raised `TypeError` when it ran.

Two claims here, and they pull against each other, which is why both are written down. Nothing the
builder offers may be missing, because the umbrella exists for values the library could not name and a
narrowing by accident refuses a call that runs. And the six have to be restricted, because that is the
whole reason the façade exists.
