"""A complexity ratchet, so the measure cannot grow where nobody looks.

Twenty-six functions in the package sit above mccabe's default of 10, the worst four being `extracting`
at 32, `_dict_err` and `_object_hook` at 22 and `_build_equality_diff` at 17.

Getting them under 10 is deliberately NOT the goal. It fixes no defect, and rewriting
`_build_equality_diff` for the sake of a number would risk code the suite and mutation testing hold.

Recorded per function rather than as a count or a ceiling, because neither of those sees the growth that
matters: a function going from 11 to 32 leaves both unchanged.  `[tool.ruff.lint.mccabe]` still carries
`max-complexity = 32`, which stops a new worst before this file is read at all.

Re-record when a number drops, which is the ratchet turning. A commit that raises one should say which
function grew and why that was the cheaper answer.
