"""Which assertions a polling chain declares over a value, and which that value's own view declares.

A chain is not a second surface.  It replays the assertions recorded on it until they hold, so for a
concrete value type ``T`` it may declare only what `assert_that(T)` declares, beyond the few names
`_engine/_operations.py` says are no assertion at all, such as `not_`.  The verdict twin may declare
less again: nothing that register says reaches no verdict, the transforms `extracting` and `first`
among them.  Both lists are read from the register rather than written here, because a second list
drifts.

What is compared is the declared surface and nothing more.  All three answer a name nobody declares
through `__getattr__`, which a dynamic assertion such as `has_status` needs, so a name kept off every
declaration still type-checks there as an open call returning the chain or an outcome.
`typing_cases.py` records that as `a-name-that-exists-nowhere-on-a-chain`.

What the rule catches is a leak: `assert_that(text_probe).eventually_sync().is_positive()` type-checks
while the same call off the chain is refused, since a `str` orders and the rung asks only for an
ordering.  Overload resolution has no way to say "only if no earlier rung matched", so every rung whose
receiver a chain satisfies is one the chain reaches.  What that adds is recorded in
`poll_parity_baseline.py` and compared in both directions, so a new leak fails here and a closed one
fails too.

Which chain reaches which rung is not reasoned about here, and the reasoning was wrong twice before it
was measured.  A rung named for a value is not reachable by that value alone: the chain is covariant in
what it polls, so `bool` reaches a rung written for `int` and a `datetime` one written for `date`.  A
value spelled as a union needs a witness per member, since a tuple reaches the tuple rung and not the
list one.  A value named by a bound needs one for what a real value carries as well: a frame that walks
reaches forty-three names its view lacks where the bare bound reaches seven.

Every pair is measured instead, by a checker, over `poll_parity_cases.py`.

Three surfaces are read, not two: `check()` is generated from the same declarations through the same
rungs, so a leak into the chain is a leak into the verdict twin as well, except for the names the
register keeps off a verdict, such as the transforms `extracting` and `first`.
