"""What the checkers make of a real HTTP response from each client this library supports.

`tests/test_typing.py` pins the same dispatch against a stand-in, which is what runs everywhere.  This
file needs the clients installed, because a stand-in proves the overload is written correctly and says
nothing about whether a real `Response` still matches it.  Two of these did not: an ASGI and a WSGI
response are callables, so the callable overload claimed them before the capability that describes
them, and `has_status_code()` on a Starlette or a Flask response was a type error in all three
checkers while the runtime answered it.

Every line here has to type-check.  A diagnostic on any of them is the defect, not a finding to record.

    A checker that cannot read a package answers `Any` for everything in it, and every call on such a

    silently: its lines would keep passing while proving nothing at all.
