"""Hold every assertion that takes a type expression to failing, rather than crashing, on all of them.

`isinstance`, `issubclass` and our own cause matching all accept three shapes: a class, a union, and a
tuple of either.  Each of the assertions below accepts all three when the value *matches*, because the
builtin does the matching.  Composing the failure message is ours, and reading `__name__` off the
argument works for a class and for nothing else: a tuple has never had one, and a union only grew one
in 3.14.

That combination is the worst shape a defect can take in an assertion library.  The passing path works,
so a suite stays green while the code is right, and the moment something breaks the assertion raises
`AttributeError` out of the formatter instead of reporting what went wrong.  It was found on
`is_instance_of` by an external contributor and this table is what a sweep for the same shape turned up.

The version matters and is not decoration.  On 3.14 and later a union renders as the useless but
harmless `<Union>`, so half of these cases look fine there and fail on the supported floor.  Anything
added here has to be run on 3.10 as well as on the development interpreter.
