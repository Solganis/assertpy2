"""A failed comparison, held to printing what differs.

The third law of a failure, beside the two of `tests/test_diff_laws.py`.  The entries of a diff say what
differs.  This holds what a reader is shown of them, on every surface that prints a pair: the diff block, the
line a soft block keeps, and the headline.

1. Every row shows a difference a reader can see, or the failure says why it does not.  Two sides of two classes
   that print alike are each printed with its class.  Two sides of one class that print alike have a line of
   their own: a NaN, a class compared by identity, or the plain statement that their repr does not show it.
2. What is printed is what the value is.  A record read through its fields under ``ignore=`` or ``include=`` is
   printed as its class with the fields compared, and so is a mapping of a class of its own.
3. Printing asks nothing.  Once the failure exists, rendering it calls no ``==`` of the values and no comparator,
   and leaves the entries as they were.

A row that prints the same on both sides is not made to differ: a NaN against a NaN is one type and one repr,
and a comparator may turn down ``1`` against ``1``.  There the law is the line that says so.
