"""Relations a type checker either catches or does not, one per line, each tagged with its own name.

Nothing here runs.  The body is never called, so the checkers read it and the interpreter does not: half
of these would raise at import, which is the point of writing them down.

`tests/test_typing_negative.py` reads the tags, runs ty, mypy and pyright over this file, and compares
what each one reported against `typing_negative_baseline.py`.  The file exists because the shipped
library advertises a typed surface, and nothing measured which incompatible operands actually reach the
checkers.  A gap nobody wrote down is a gap nobody can close on purpose.
