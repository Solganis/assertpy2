"""Hold the order of the `assert_that()` overloads, which nothing else announces when it breaks.

A `pandas.DataFrame` is assignable to *every* structural protocol, because pandas models column access
with a catch-all attribute.  So the frame overload works only while it is the first shape-keyed one: put
anything else above it and every frame silently resolves to that instead, with no error anywhere.  The
same catch-all is why a checker cannot be asked about it cheaply, and why this reads the source instead.

Two gates, deliberately apart.  This one is about what is written, needs no third-party library, and
runs everywhere.  `tests/test_typing.py` is about what a checker picks, and pins each shape to its view
with `assert_type`.  Neither replaces the other: source order can be right while a checker resolves
elsewhere, and a checker can agree today while an edit reorders the file tomorrow.

The public API snapshot records the overloads too, but it is re-recorded whenever the surface moves, so
a broken invariant travels through it as an ordinary diff.  This says the invariant out loud.
