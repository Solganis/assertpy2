"""Source-level guard: every ``error()`` inside an ``except`` block decides about the caught exception.

``error()`` owns the ``raise``, so whether the exception being handled stays visible above the failure
is settled at the call site and nowhere else.  Nothing else enforces that.  A new wrapping assertion
written without the keyword passes lint, the whole suite and full coverage, which is how two of the
sites below went unnoticed once already.

Read from the source rather than watched at runtime, so a site no test happens to reach is found too,
and so ``builder.error(...)`` counts the same as ``self.error(...)``.  The runtime side of the same
invariant lives in ``TestExceptionContext`` in test_traceback.py.
