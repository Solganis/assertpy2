"""Hold the chain model's bounded corpus to what the four checkers said about it when it was recorded.

The corpus is generated from the model's transition table (`tests/chain_corpus.py`) into a scratch folder
each run, and each checker's diagnostics on it have to be the recorded ones, in both directions and codes
included.  A declaration rewritten to say the same thing leaves this green, and one that says anything
else, better or worse, has to be recorded on purpose.

Most of what is recorded is a pin the library does not meet yet: a polled callable after an expectation
reads `Any`, `raised()` and `returned()` read `object`, and ty loses the element after a polled pivot.

Skipped where the checkers are absent, like the other typing gates: the lint job runs it.
