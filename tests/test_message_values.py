"""A value a failure message prints is capped, in every assertion and not in one.

`is_equal_to` capped the values of its first line.  A hundred other messages printed theirs whole, so a failed
``is_length`` over 300 rows put 15 000 characters ahead of the length it was about, and a value of megabytes went
into the log as one line.

Held two ways.  By the tree: no f-string field calls `_safe_str`, `_safe_repr`, `str` or `repr` on a value.
That is the reach of the search and no more: a value put in a variable first, or through ``format``, passes
it.  By a run of each family of assertion over a value far past the cap: the line stays within reach of it,
says how much it left out, still ends in what was asked, and the failure holds the value whole.

A capped value keeps both its ends.  Two texts held against each other are cut around the place they part by
the rule of the assertion, so a comparison that ignores case is not shown a difference of case.  A value
within the cap prints as it always did, a text with line breaks in it included: the break is not escaped, and
the predicate then stands on a later line.
