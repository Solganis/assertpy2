"""The static check for `assert_that()` statements that assert nothing.

Both halves matter equally.  A check that misses the shape it exists for is useless, and a check that
reports a working chain gets switched off after the first false alarm and never switched back on, so
the negative cases below are the ones that keep it usable.
