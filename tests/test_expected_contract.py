"""Every assertion either names what it measured against, or is written down as one that cannot.

`AssertionOutcome.expected` is what a report consumer reads: an Allure attachment, a dashboard, a
clustering key.  For most of the library that is the operand the assertion was handed, and for a while
only 22 of the 163 failure sites passed it, so the same question got a different answer depending on
which assertion had failed.

What cannot name one is a real category rather than an oversight, and this file is the boundary between
the two.  A negation was handed a value the subject must *not* be, and putting that under `expected`
would tell a reader the opposite of the truth.  A predicate with no operand was handed nothing at all.
Both are listed below with which of the two they are, so a new assertion has to be decided about.
