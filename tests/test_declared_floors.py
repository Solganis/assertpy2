"""The floors job has to cover every range the package publishes, cell by cell.

`pyproject.toml` states a lower bound for each optional dependency, and a bound nobody installs is a
promise nobody checks. Three of them were wrong when this was first measured: `asttokens>=2.0` cannot
mark the tokens of the file it rewrites, `behave>=1.2.6` has no `ParseMatcher.TYPE_REGISTRY` for our
parser to register with, and `starlette>=0.40` reaches a function deprecated in 3.14.

Static, and deliberately so: the job itself is the thing that installs and runs. What this file stops is
a dependency added later that quietly escapes it, in either of the two ways it can. An extra no cell
installs is a range nobody checks, and a library a cell installs without naming it in that cell's import
probe can install, fail to import there, and turn its own tests into skips while the cell stays green.

Per cell rather than over their union, because the cells differ on purpose and a library dropped from one
probe is still named by the others.
