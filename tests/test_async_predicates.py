"""A coroutine handed to an assertion as a predicate, which used to read as a verdict.

A coroutine object is truthy and an unawaited one never runs, so `async def` predicates made the
assertions that read them pass whatever the value was.  Measured before the fix: ten of the thirteen
places that take a callable went green on a predicate that always answers `False`.

The refusal is asked of the answer rather than of the callable, so a lambda handing one back is caught
as well, and it carries its own exception type because several assertions catch `TypeError` from a probe
on purpose and would otherwise report the mistake as an ordinary non-match.
