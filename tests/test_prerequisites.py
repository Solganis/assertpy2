"""Negation inverts the answer to a question, never whether the question could be asked.

Each site below asks something the subject has to be fit for first: a permission of the file at a
path, the name of that file, the value of a field, the keys an ``include=`` compares, the group a
pattern captures.  Each used to report the unfit subject as its answer, so ``not_`` read "the path
does not exist" as "the file is not readable" and passed.  The exception-group family went first and
is covered in `test_expected_exception.py`.
