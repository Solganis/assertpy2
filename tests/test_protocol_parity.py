"""Parity between the typed Protocols and the concrete ``AssertionBuilder``.

The Protocols in :mod:`assertpy2._engine._typing` are hand-maintained and exist only under ``TYPE_CHECKING``,
so nothing at runtime stops them from advertising a method the concrete builder does not have (or
whose signature no longer accepts the declared arguments).  These tests parse the module with ``ast``
and verify every declared method against the real class, so that drift fails the suite instead of
surfacing as a user's ``AttributeError`` on a method their IDE offered.

The reverse direction is asserted too, per mixin rather than against the whole surface.  Each Protocol
is the narrowed view ``assert_that`` returns for one family of types, so a method added to
``StringMixin`` and not to ``_StringAssertion`` is invisible to every caller holding a ``str`` - it
works at runtime and fails the type check.  A curated subset is still a subset of something, and which
methods are deliberately left out is written below as data rather than as a claim in this docstring.
