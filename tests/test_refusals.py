"""Every refusal of a wrong type says the same kind of sentence, whichever assertion produced it.

A refusal is not an assertion failure: it means the test itself is wrong, and the reader is a developer
looking at their own call.  What that reader needs is which operand was rejected, what was expected of
it, and what arrived instead.  Ninety-three different phrasings across the package used to answer at
most two of the three, and which two depended on the assertion.

The gate drives every public assertion with operands of the wrong type and holds each `TypeError` to
one shape.  It is written as a sweep rather than as a list of cases on purpose: a list would be a
second place to remember, and a new assertion added next year would simply not be in it.
