"""Hold the generated verdict twins to what the generator produces from the protocols they mirror.

`check()` runs one assertion for its verdict instead of its failure, so every assertion is reachable
through it with the return type replaced.  Written by hand that is a second copy of 182 declarations
kept in step by nobody, and the copy drifts silently: a signature changes on one side and the check
surface keeps promising the old one.

Generated instead, and regenerated here.  A difference means the file on disk was edited or the
protocols moved without the twins following, and either way the answer is to run the generator.
