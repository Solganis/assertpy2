"""What a value is asked *about* is read off its base type, never off the value.

Twice now the same question was answered by the value: `is_infinite` in one release and `is_nan` in the
next, in two helpers that decide whether a signal is a verdict or a bug in the value.  Both were found
by hand, both from the same subclass trick, so the rule is stated here over the source instead.

The rule is narrow on purpose.  Duck typing is the library's contract and a value answers for almost
everything it is asked.  What it must not answer is the library's *own* question about what kind of
thing it is, because that answer decides which of two error paths a reader is sent down.
