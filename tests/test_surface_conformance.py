"""One failure driven through every delivery surface, compared surface against surface.

The surfaces differ on purpose: a soft block numbers its entries and prints one line per differing
path, warn mode logs instead of raising, and a polling failure prefixes its own timeout line.  That
deliberate difference in shape is exactly why they need a shared gate, because twice now it carried an
undeliberate difference in *content* along with it: a hint that reached one mode and not another, and a
long string whose position of change the block form pointed at while the compact form said nothing.

What is asserted here is agreement, not format.  Each surface is reduced to the three things a reader
acts on: the headline, the one-cause hint, and the set of paths named underneath.  A test that pins the
exact text of one mode belongs next to that mode (`test_soft.py`, `test_warn.py`); a test that says two
modes must say the same thing belongs here.
