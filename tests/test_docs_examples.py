"""Execute the copy-paste code examples in the guide docs so they cannot silently rot.

The guarded pages are the ones whose python blocks are mostly runnable. Illustrative pseudo-context
blocks (``repo.find(42)``, a bare ``response``, ...) carry an HTML comment ``<!-- docs-guard: skip -->``
directly above their fence; that comment is invisible in the rendered site and tells this guard to
skip them. A new example is therefore either runnable or explicitly marked - it cannot slip through
unchecked.

``<!-- docs-guard: raises -->`` marks a block that shows what a failure looks like, so running it here
would fail the suite for doing what the page says it does. It is the mirror of test_docs_typing's
``untyped`` marker, and both exist rather than widening ``skip`` so that neither takes a block out of
both guards.

One test per page, blocks in document order. A guide is written as a narrative and its blocks build on
each other through whatever the library holds process-wide: `matchers.md` registers a matcher in one
block and removes it in another, which passed only while the suite happened to run them in that order.
Under a shuffling runner two seeds in four went red. A failure names the block it came from.
