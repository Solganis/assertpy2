"""Awkward numbers, crossed with every spelling of the numeric questions, each held to what it must answer.

Six defect groups lived here at once, each found by crossing these values rather than by a test someone thought
to write: a `Fraction` past the float range, a `numpy` float against a bignum, a signalling `Decimal`, a NaN bound,
a `numpy` NaN, and a private error class escaping a tolerance.  Every value has its place on the extended real
line, an infinity by its sign and anything finite by its exact `Fraction`, or none for a NaN, and every spelling
of a question is held to the answer that place gives: held, failed, or refused in the one sentence of the
library's that the case calls for.  Anything else, another answer, another sentence or another exception, is a
finding.

The `numpy` values join when the data extra is installed.
