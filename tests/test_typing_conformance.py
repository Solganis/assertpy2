"""Hold the typed surface and the runtime to the same signature, parameter by parameter.

`tests/test_protocol_parity.py` asks whether every declared method exists and whether the runtime
*accepts* what a declaration marks required.  That leaves six questions, and each of them is a way for
the two halves to drift while both gates stay green:

* the runtime accepts a parameter no declaration mentions, so a caller cannot pass it without a cast
* a declaration names one the runtime has not got, so the call type-checks and raises
* they disagree about how a parameter may be passed, so a keyword the checker allows is refused
* they disagree about whether it is required, so an omission the checker allows fails at run time
* between them the views refuse a value the runtime accepts, so no caller can write a working call
* a view offers one the runtime never promised, so the call type-checks on a signature that excludes it

The last two are a different kind of blindness from the first four.  Conformance to a protocol is
contravariant in parameters, so a view narrower than the runtime satisfies it however far it narrows,
and no checker has anything to report either way round.

This is the conformance half of the plan, and only its reporting half: it compares and complains and
generates nothing.  What it replaces is the audit that used to be done by hand, once, whenever somebody
remembered to wonder.
