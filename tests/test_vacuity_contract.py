"""Guards the one failure mode an assertion library must never have: passing without asserting.

A green test that checked nothing is worse than a red one, because nobody goes looking for it. Two
shapes of that bug are reachable here. An assertion can be handed no arguments to check against, and
a quantifier can be handed an empty subject. The first has nothing to assert and must be refused. The
second is true by definition, so it stays allowed and is pinned below as a deliberate contract rather
than left as an accident that a rewrite could flip in silence.
