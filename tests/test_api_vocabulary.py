"""The naming vocabulary, as a gate rather than as a convention.

A reader who has met `is_empty` and `contains_key` should be able to guess `is_not_empty` and
`does_not_contain_key` without looking, which holds only while every new name follows the same rules.
The rules here are not invented, they are what the surface already does. What this adds is that the
next name has to do it too, and that every name which does not says why.
