"""Every assertion and its negation, held to being one question asked twice.

A pair is two assertions meant as complements: `is_X` and `is_not_X`, `contains_X` and
`does_not_contain_X`, `has_X` and `does_not_have_X`, `matches` and `does_not_match`, and the few that are
complements by meaning rather than by name, such as `is_true` and `is_false`.  Duality, asked of one
value and one set of arguments, is three things:

1. Complement.  Exactly one of the two passes, or both refuse alike.  A refusal (an `Exception` raised
   that is not an `AssertionError`) is not a verdict, so it cannot come from one side only: a value the
   positive cannot examine, the negative cannot examine either.  Two refusals are alike when they carry
   the same message and derive from the same builtin class.  Which class below that is raised is not
   public API, so an asymmetry there is outside this property.
2. `not_`.  `assert_that(v).not_.name(*args)` fails where `name(*args)` passes, passes where it fails,
   and refuses alike where it refuses.
3. `check()`.  `assert_that(v).check().name(*args)` never raises an `AssertionError`.  Its outcome's
   `passed` is the hard verdict, and a refusal is raised unchanged.  `check().not_` answers what `not_`
   answers.

A failure on something the question presupposes is not a verdict either.  A pair whose value can miss its
prerequisite declares it and says why in `_PREREQUISITES`: the group assertions ask what a caught group
holds, and a caught exception that is not a group answers neither that nor its negation.  There both
members fail on every surface with one message, and `not_` delivers the hard failure as it stands.  Only
arguments refused alike on a value meeting the prerequisite are refused there instead.

(2) and (3) are asked of both members of every pair, including the calls only one member takes.  (1) is
asked where both take the call.  A pair that is a complement only in part says which part in
`_RESTRICTED`, and what still holds outside that part is asserted rather than skipped.  A defect the
library has today is an exact entry in `_KNOWN_READS`: the member, the operand type, the library function
the refusal leaves, and the operand's own method that raises it.  Only a case matching an entry is excused,
and only that refusal: the other member is held to what it answers with that operand made plain, and the
plain case to the whole property with no excuse.  Each entry has a reproduction run as
`xfail(strict=True)`, so the fix turns it red and the entry has to go.

The pairs named as negations are read off the builder with the vocabulary `tests/test_api_vocabulary.py`
gates, so a new negation is either tested here or says why it is not.  That covers naming patterns, not
every semantic opposite: `_BY_MEANING` lists the complements found by reading the surface, and an opposite
that no naming rule reaches and nobody listed is held to nothing here.
