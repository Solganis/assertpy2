"""Type-check the code examples in the README and the guide docs.

The badge promises three type checkers with zero suppressions, and the README's own first listing used
to fail all three: `has_name` on a dict is resolved dynamically at runtime and no protocol declares it.
Executing the snippets (test_docs_examples.py) cannot catch that, because the code runs perfectly well.

Three markers steer this guard, all invisible in the rendered page:

* ``<!-- docs-guard: skip -->``       the block is illustrative and not runnable, so neither guard reads it
* ``<!-- docs-guard: untyped -->``    the block runs, and is excluded from here for a reason this guard
  cannot resolve: a dynamic assertion (``has_<attr>``), which is deliberately outside the typed surface,
  or a name that only exists above the supported floor. ``ty`` reads ``requires-python``, so a 3.11
  builtin like ``ExceptionGroup`` is undefined to it even where the example is correct.
* ``<!-- docs-guard: type-error -->`` the block demonstrates a rejection, so it has to fail the check.
  A counter-example that silently starts passing is how a page's promise rots unnoticed.

Anything else has to type-check, which also means this guard reports the reverse of what
test_protocol_parity.py reports: parity proves every declared method exists, this proves the methods
the docs actually use are declared.
