"""The exception-group classes, taken the way assertpy2 itself takes them.

Groups are a 3.11+ builtin, and below that the library falls back to the ``exceptiongroup`` backport
(``assertpy2/_engine/_compat.py``).  The group tests used to skip on 3.10 outright, which left the
fallback path that ships there unexercised.  Resolving the classes here once keeps both the example-based
and the property-based suite pointed at whatever the interpreter under test actually has.

Both names shadow the builtins on purpose, the way ``_compat`` does inside the library: a test then reads
the same as the code it checks.  They are ``None`` only on a 3.10 install without the optional backport,
which is the one case where there is nothing to test against.
