"""Hold the two proxies to the operations that actually reach a verdict.

`not_` inverts a verdict and `check()` reports one, so an operation that reaches neither means nothing
through either.  Both used to take them: `assert_that(1).not_.check()` failed with "Expected <1> to NOT
satisfy: check()", and `assert_that([1]).check().first()` answered `passed=True` for a pivot that had
asserted nothing at all.  The second is the worse of the two, because it reads as a verdict.

Two halves.  The register in `assertpy2/_engine/_operations.py` is re-derived from the source here, so
an operation that stops asserting cannot quietly stay negatable.  And the refusals are exercised, so
the register is not just a list that agrees with itself.
