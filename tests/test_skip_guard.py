"""The guard that stops a skipped gate from reading as a passing one.

A dependency that is not installed does not fail a run, it skips it, and a skipped gate leaves no mark
in a green summary.  That cost two red CI runs in one day: `pytest-examples` lives in its own group,
was absent locally, and the whole doc-example file was skipped while the run was reported as passing.

The guard lives in `tests/conftest.py` and is loaded here as a plugin rather than copied, so what these
cases exercise is the shipped one.
