"""What `assert_that()` hands back for values from the real libraries, pinned per case.

`tests/test_typing.py` pins the same relation against stand-in classes, which is what runs everywhere.
This file needs pandas, polars and numpy installed and is checked by `tests/test_typing_integrations.py`,
because a stand-in proves the overload is written correctly and says nothing about whether a real
`DataFrame` still matches it.  Both are needed: the shapes are structural, and the structures belong to
somebody else.

Each line carries its case name, and `tests/typing_integrations_baseline.py` records which checkers
report anything on it.  A case every checker agrees with records nothing.
