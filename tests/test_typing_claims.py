"""Guard the two claims the project makes about its own type checking.

The README badge and `docs/concepts/type-safety.md` promise that ty, mypy ``--strict`` and Pyright all
run against ``tests/test_typing.py`` **with zero suppressions**.  That is prose, and prose drifts: one
``# type: ignore`` added to silence an inconvenient checker would leave the badge saying something
untrue with nothing to notice.  The first test below turns the sentence into a gate.

The second is the project's own rule rather than a public claim: a suppression anywhere in the package
has to say why it is there, so the next reader can judge whether it still applies.  Both are cheap
checks over source text, which is exactly the shape of claim no other test can reach.
