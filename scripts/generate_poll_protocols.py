"""Generate the polling twins of the assertion protocols.

A polling chain records the assertion and replays it until it holds, so every assertion is available
through it with the return type replaced by the chain itself.  Both builders resolve the name at run
time through `__getattr__`, which no checker can read: until this existed, a polling chain was `Any`
from the first assertion onwards, and `eventually_sync().method_that_does_not_exist()` passed all
three checkers.

The twins are one flat protocol per flavour rather than one per view, and each assertion carries the
value types it applies to in its own ``self`` annotation.  A view per value type would have to be
chosen by `eventually_sync()`, whose overloads see the probe's return type: measured, a probe with no
annotation returns `Any`, an `Any` self matches the first rung, and every checker then reported a
string assertion on a chain that polls anything.  Per-assertion ``self`` inverts that: an `Any` chain
matches every rung and keeps the freedom it has today, and an annotated one is held to its type.

Two more shapes were measured against the same pair of questions, and both fail on the second one.  The
questions: does a string chain refuse `is_positive()`, and does an unannotated probe keep
`has_status("PAID")`.

* **a view per value type.**  The assertion is not declared on the view at all, so `__getattr__` answers
  it and nothing is refused.  Taking the hook off does refuse it on all three, and then mypy refuses
  `has_status("PAID")` on an unannotated probe, which is the idiom the hook exists for.
* **a view per value type, hook kept, with the assertions a view does not carry declared as
  non-callable sentinels** so a declaration shadows the hook.  This one does refuse the string chain on
  all three.  It also collapses on an unannotated probe, where the sentinel turns into a false
  rejection: pyright refuses `has_status("PAID")`, and mypy and pyright refuse a numeric assertion that
  is correct.

So the flat protocol is the only shape measured that refuses anything at all while the hook keeps
working, and what it cannot refuse is a value whose own view is narrower than the umbrella: overload
resolution has no way to say "only if no earlier rung matched".  `str` binds `_CapableT` by being
iterable, and there is no negation to exclude a type that has a view of its own.

Half of that is reachable anyway, and the half that is turns on where the *operands* come from.  A rung
is emitted per protocol *and per binding*, since `_TextAssertion` reaches `_RepeatableAssertion[str]`
while `_ListAssertion[_E]` reaches `_RepeatableAssertion[_E]`, and one rung covering both left `_E`
free for a text chain to bind off the argument.  The umbrella rung then has to read the element off the
receiver rather than leave it open, which is what `contains_in_order` asks `Iterable[_E]` for.  Both are
needed: measured, the split alone changes nothing, and the restriction alone changes nothing.

What that closes is an operand of the wrong type on a polled string, on mypy and pyright.  What stays
open is an assertion the value answers structurally, `is_positive()` on a polled string being the one
recorded: `str` orders, so the umbrella rung matches however the operands are typed.

Where that leaves the residue is worth naming, because it is not here.  `assert_that()` hands a value
the umbrella claims the whole builder, so `assert_that(mapping_shaped).is_positive()` type-checks off
the chain too and raises when it runs.  Narrowing the chain alone would leave a polled value stricter
than the same value off it, so the repair belongs to the umbrella.  Both are recorded as cases in
`tests/typing_negative_baseline.py`.

Rungs follow the order `assert_that()` dispatches in, since they answer the same question.

_HEADER = '''"""The polling twin of every assertion protocol, generated by `scripts/generate_poll_protocols.py`.

Do not edit.  A polling chain replays the assertions recorded on it until they hold together, so it
offers the same assertions the value's own view does and hands back the chain rather than a builder.

Which assertions a chain offers follows the probe's return type, carried in each ``self`` annotation
rather than in the chain's class: see the generator for why the alternative reported a string
assertion on every chain built from an unannotated probe.

A name nobody declares stays open, because `__getattr__` answers it.  That is what keeps
``has_status("PAID")`` working: a dynamic assertion is resolved from the polled value's own
attributes, and no declaration can list it.  It hands back the chain over the same value rather than
one over an unknown, so the assertions after it are still read.  A name that *is* declared still
refuses a chain it was not declared for, measured on mypy and pyright: the hook answers only what the
declarations do not.

What the chain is *not* held to is the surface of a value the capability umbrella claims.  Each
assertion carries a last rung for it, because that is the surface `assert_that()` hands such a value,
and Python's overload resolution has no way to say "only if no earlier rung matched".  So a `str`,
being iterable, reaches rungs the string view does not carry.

Its *operands* are held, though, where the value's own type says what they are: a rung is emitted per
binding as well as per protocol, so a chain over text takes the elements text has rather than any the
argument happens to be.

Do not edit.  `not_` on a view hands one of these back, and every assertion on it hands the view back:
`NegatedBuilder` inverts one assertion and returns the builder it wrapped, so the type has to say
`positive -> negated -> positive` rather than making the negation permanent.

The narrowing ladders are absent by construction.  A negated `is_instance_of(str)` asserts the value is
*not* a string, so answering the string view promises the opposite of what was checked: that shipped,
typed an `int` as `str`, and all four checkers accepted it.
