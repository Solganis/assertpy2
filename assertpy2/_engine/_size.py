"""Size as one decision: how long a value is, or that it has no length at all.

`len()` answers both questions at once by raising, and the two callers need them apart.  A builder
refuses a value with no length, because a wrong subject there is a mistake in the test.  A matcher
answers "no match", because it feeds `==` and the combinators, where raising would be wrong.  Written
separately, the two used a different rule for what "has no length" means: one asked the protocol, the
other caught `TypeError` and so also swallowed a `__len__` of the user's own that raised.
