"""The equality decision itself, with nothing around it.

Equality was already computed in one place structurally: `_sub_diff_entries` walks both sides and the
compare config travels with it.  What was not in one place was the *entry* to that walk.  The recursive
mapping comparison, the ignore/include filtering and the dict-shape test lived on `HelpersMixin`, which
made them reachable from a builder and from nowhere else.  A matcher therefore could not offer
`tolerance`, `ignore`, `include`, `comparators` or `ignore_null` at all: `match.equal_to(x, tolerance=0.1)`
raised `TypeError` while `assert_that(v).is_equal_to(x, tolerance=0.1)` worked, and the two spellings of
one relation answered different questions.

Everything here is a free function over values.  The mixin keeps thin wrappers so that an extension
calling `self._dict_not_equal(...)` still works, and the matcher calls the same functions directly.
