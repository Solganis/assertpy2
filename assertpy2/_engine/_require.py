"""One shape for every refusal of a wrong type, and one place that decides how it reads.

An assertion refuses a value or an argument in two situations, and until now each site worded its own:
ninety-three different phrasings across a hundred and fifty-nine sites, for about ten actual
situations.  Ten of them said "not a number" and eleven said "not a string", differing in whether the
offending value appeared at all, whether its type did, and in what order.  The reader could not learn
the format once, because there was no format.

The shape here is::

    <subject> must be <expectation>, but was <value> (<type>)

`subject` is `val` for the value under assertion and `given <name> arg` for an argument, which is the
wording the package already used where it named the operand at all.  The value is shown because that is
the question a reader actually has: not *that* the type was wrong, but *what arrived* instead.  A
payload field that came back as the string ``"12"`` rather than the number ``12`` is invisible in
"val is not numeric" and obvious in ``but was <'12'> (str)``.

The type is printed next to the value even when `repr` already implies it.  `'12'` and `12` are told
apart by their quotes, but `Decimal("1")`, a numpy scalar and any class with a hand-written `__repr__`
are not, and a rule with an exception is a rule nobody can rely on.
