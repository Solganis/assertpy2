"""Group a run's failures by the difference they share, so a wall of red reads as one cause.

Forty failing tests are usually not forty problems.  A fixture that changed one field fails every test
that touches it, and pytest reports each one on its own because a rendered `AssertionError` is all it
has.  This library keeps the comparison as structure, so the same forty can be answered in a line:
*thirty-seven of them differ at `user.role`*.

The grouping is by equality, never by likeness.  Two failures share a cluster when their signatures are
equal, and a signature is built from the diff itself.  There is no similarity score to tune and no
ordering to depend on: the same run produces the same clusters.

Where a value is identified rather than compared, what stands for it is its stable repr, so two values
that print alike count as one difference.  That is a real limit and the honest one to state: a summary
cannot hold the values themselves without shipping a run's whole payload between processes.

**The key is the place, not the values, and that was measured rather than assumed.**  An earlier
edition put the values in the key, which reads as the safer choice and quietly narrows the feature to
one case: a broken constant, where all forty failures show the same pair.  A broken *formula* differs
at the same field with a value of its own per test, and keying on values scattered it into forty
clusters of one.  Both are ordinary, and only the first was covered.

So an entry is keyed on its path whenever the path is a coordinate (`key`, `index`, `attr` or `line`
steps).  Values are collected as examples instead, and a cluster whose values disagree says so rather
than printing one pair as though it explained every failure it holds.

**Three kinds of difference carry no coordinate at all**, which an audit of every diff kind this
library emits established:

* a `contains` failure names `missing` or `extra`, which is a label, not a place - an item that is not
  in a list has no position in it;
* a `set` entry's step holds the *member*, since a set has no index to give;
* a `scalar` entry is the whole value, and its path renders as `.`.

Keying those on their path would put every unrelated `contains` failure in one cluster called
`missing`.  They fall back to the diagnostic line the failure already carries - *every difference here
is one of surrounding whitespace* - which is the same difference stated as a kind rather than a place.

Without a diagnostic, only the kinds whose two fields really hold the compared values fall back to
them.  `contains` and `set` do not: there the fields hold *presence*, so a missing item reports `None`
on the actual side, and a heading built from that tells the reader their value was `None` when it was
a list of three.  Those two stay out of the summary rather than getting a second rendering, which was
the cheaper half of a measurement showing they clustered almost nothing.
