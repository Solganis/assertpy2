        val is validated against the schema declared for the ``application/json`` response of the
        ``method``/``path`` operation in ``spec``. This checks only the response body of that one
        operation - not request bodies, parameters, headers, or the spec as a whole.

        OpenAPI 3.0 (its ``nullable`` keyword is honoured), 3.1, and Swagger 2.0 (schema declared directly
        on the response, its ``x-nullable`` extension honoured) are all supported. ``$ref``,
        ``oneOf``/``allOf``/``anyOf`` and ``enum`` all validate with full JSON-Schema semantics, and every
        violation is reported with its JSON path.

        Under OpenAPI 3.0, ``nullable: true`` adds ``null`` to the ``type`` beside it and leaves an ``enum``
        as written, so ``null`` passes an enum only where the enum lists it.  A property marked
        ``writeOnly: true`` is not asked for by ``required``, since val is a response.

        A ``format`` is checked where there is a check for it: ``date``, ``time``, ``date-time``, ``email``,
        ``ipv4``, ``ipv6``, ``uuid``, ``regex``, ``uri``, ``hostname``, ``duration``, and OpenAPI's ``int32``
        and ``int64``.  A ``time`` is RFC 3339's, with its offset: ``10:00:00Z``, and not ``10:00:00``.  A
        ``hostname`` under OpenAPI 3.1 has its ``xn--`` labels held to IDNA by the ``idna`` package.  The
        others jsonschema checks only beside a package of their own, ``uri-reference``,
        ``iri``, ``json-pointer`` and ``uri-template`` among them, are checked where that package is
        installed (``jsonschema[format-nongpl]`` brings them all), and pass unchecked where it is not.

        Args:
            spec: a parsed OpenAPI document (dict); loading YAML/JSON is the caller's job.
            path: the operation's path template, e.g. ``"/orders/{id}"``.
            method: the HTTP method, e.g. ``"get"`` (case-insensitive).
            status: response status to validate against; defaults to ``200``, then ``201``, then the range
                ``2XX``, then ``default``.  A status is looked up by its own code, then by its range
                (``404`` under ``4XX``), then under ``default``.  Swagger 2.0 has no ranges.
            content_type: response content type; defaults to ``"application/json"``. Swagger 2.0 has no
                content-type layer, so it is checked against the operation's ``produces`` list instead
                (and skipped when the spec declares none).

        Examples:
            Usage:

                spec = {...}  # your parsed OpenAPI document
                assert_that(response.json()).conforms_to_openapi(spec, "/orders/{id}", "get")
