"""Find `assert_that(...)` statements that assert nothing.

Two shapes pass every test runner in silence:

    assert_that(items)              # a builder is built and thrown away
    assert_that(items).is_empty     # the assertion is looked up and never called

Neither can happen with a bare ``assert``, so a fluent API owes its users a way to catch them.  The
second shape is already reported by ruff's B018 (useless attribute access); the first is not reported
by anything, because a call may have side effects and no linter can know this one does not.

The check is static and runs at collection.  A runtime version was tried first and rejected: marking
the builder from a wrapper adds a stack frame, and `snapshot()` / `matches_inline()` resolve their
caller with a single `f_back` hop from inside the method body (see `_require_caller` in snapshot.py,
whose docstring says exactly why the hop count must not move).  Reading the source costs nothing at
runtime and cannot shift a frame.

What it deliberately does not flag:

* a builder bound to a name (`b = assert_that(x)`), because whether `b` is used later is not a
  question about this statement, and ruff's F841 answers it when the answer is never;
* `assert_conforms()`, `fail()`, `soft_fail()`, which assert on their own rather than returning a
  builder, so a bare call to them is correct usage.

A chain ending on a pivot or a configurer is the same defect wearing a longer tail:
``assert_that(load).raises(ValueError)`` never calls anything, and ``assert_that(rows).extracting("id")``
throws the extracted value away.  Both were left out while the set of operations that reach no verdict
was only a runtime property; `assertpy2/_engine/_operations.py` states it now, and a gate keeps it in
step with the source, so reading it here cannot rot.

An ``assert`` in front reads the chain instead of discarding it, and a builder and a bound method are
both truthy, so ``assert assert_that(items).is_empty`` is green on every value.  Neither B018 nor
coverage sees that one: the value is consumed rather than dropped, and the line does run.  What the
``assert`` reads is the whole question, since ``assert assert_that(x).val`` tests that value instead,
and the register names the members that hand it back.
