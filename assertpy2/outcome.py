"""The record of one failed assertion, between composing it and doing something about it.

`AssertionBuilder.error()` used to do both jobs in one body: it built the message, and then it decided
whether to raise, collect or log.  Only the string survived that function, which is why the soft
collector can hold nothing else, why there is nowhere to hand a caller a result instead of an
exception, and why `eventually()` has to bypass `error()` entirely to attach its poll trace.

Splitting the two leaves a record in the middle.  This is that record.  It carries what was composed,
not what should happen to it: the decision belongs to the delivery half, which reads the builder's
mode.

`check()` is the first caller outside this package to read one, so the type is exported and documented
from here on.  What it does **not** promise yet is that no field will be added: the soft collector is
next to hold these, and holding them is what will tell whether a failure's location belongs on the
record too.
