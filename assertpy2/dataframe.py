"""Optional fluent assertions for data-science containers (pandas / polars / numpy).

This is an *integration* layer in the same spirit as the Allure and Behave adapters: each library is its
own optional extra (``pip install assertpy2[pandas]`` / ``[polars]`` / ``[numpy]``, or ``[data]`` for all
three), imported lazily by name, so the core stays free of runtime dependencies.  Comparison
**semantics** are delegated to each library's own testing utilities (``assert_frame_equal`` /
``assert_series_equal`` / ``assert_array_equal`` / ``assert_allclose``), so dtype, tolerance and NaN
handling are the library's, with the exceptions this layer adds: ``is_array_equal`` compares the shapes
before numpy does, and ``is_array_close_to`` defaults its tolerances to those of ``numpy.isclose`` and
takes no ``NaN`` as equal unless asked.  Otherwise this layer adds the fluent entry point and routes
failures through the standard assertpy2 error model.
