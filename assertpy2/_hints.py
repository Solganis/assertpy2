"""One line naming *why* two values differ, when the whole difference has a single explanation.

The diff says what differs, which is where every assertion library stops.  It leaves the reader to
work out why, and there are failures where that is genuinely hard: two strings that render
identically and differ in a trailing space, a comparison that can never pass because a NaN is in it.

A hint is stated only when it accounts for **every** entry in the diff.  A partial explanation is
worse than none, because the reader acts on it and lands back at the same failure.  That rule is what
keeps this from becoming the kind of advice people learn to scroll past, and it is measurable: over a
corpus of 20000 ordinary failures (a wrong leaf somewhere in a generated structure) the checks below
stay silent on all of them, and over a set of near misses built to resemble each form without being
it, likewise.

Everything here reads the diff rather than the values.  That is not only cheaper, though it is: the
diff of a failure over 500 records holds one entry, so the cost does not grow with the data.  It also
means a difference nested six levels down is examined exactly like a top-level one, with no separate
code path.

    Two separate instances of a type that leaves ``__eq__`` to ``object`` are never equal, whatever they

    making: state can live in a slot, in a descriptor's own table or in a C field, and a line that promised
    to have read all of it would be promising more than any reading can deliver.  It is said of two of one
    type only: a value of another type may answer the reflected comparison its own way.

    Three details make the answer trustworthy, and each was put here by a case that defeated the one
    before it.  It is asked before the comparison, because a type may rewrite its own ``__eq__`` while
    answering one, and a question asked afterwards would be answered by the type it left behind.  It
    reads no attribute of the class, not even through `type.__getattribute__`: that runs a descriptor
    the class holds under the name, and one that installs an equality while being asked failed a pair
    its own ``==`` held equal.  And what it reads is the class tree's own namespaces, in the order the
    tree has them, the way `slot_tp_richcompare` reads them, off the slots of `type`, which a metaclass
    cannot spell.  The tree is the real one: a metaclass's own ``mro()`` can put another class first, and
    that class's equality is then the one ``==`` runs.

    ``None`` is an answer: a class that writes ``__eq__ = None`` has said what its equality is.  A tree in
    which no class writes one, which reassigning ``__bases__`` under such a metaclass can leave behind, is
    no claim of identity.  A list and a tuple are answered before any namespace is read.  Scalars reach
    none of it: their comparison returns before this is asked.

    One thing a namespace can still run: a key of a class of its own, a `str` subclass, that compares itself
    and may answer one lookup one way and the next another.  Identity is therefore claimed only of a tree whose
    namespaces hold exact `str` keys alone (`_plainly_keyed`), which is read where the claim is about to be
    made and nowhere else: a tree that writes an equality of its own never pays for it.

    The first class of the tree answers for a type that writes its equality itself, at 105 ns where the
    look through the class it replaces took 76.  One that inherits it pays about 50 ns more a level.

    ``__ne__`` is not asked about: the comparison a failing assertion runs is ``actual == expected``, so a
