"""What a failure says about the HTTP response it came from, and the one step into that response's body.

Duck-typed, like the pydantic and attrs support: nothing here imports httpx, requests, Starlette, Flask
or Django, and installing any of them next to this library costs nothing.  A response is recognised by
what it *is* rather than by what it is called, and by the values of those attributes rather than by
their names alone.  Names alone are not enough: a ``DataFrame`` with columns called ``status_code`` and
``headers`` answers to both, a ``MagicMock`` answers to anything at all, and attaching an authoritative
HTTP reading to somebody else's failure is worse than saying nothing.

The provenance line reads no body and starts no I/O.  That is not caution, it is the only correct rule:
a streaming httpx response raises ``ResponseNotRead`` when its ``.text`` is touched, a chunked requests
body is consumed by reading it, and a body has no size limit.  A failure being reported is not the place
to discover any of that.  Reading the body is what `decoded_as_json()` does, and calling it is the
caller saying they want it read.
