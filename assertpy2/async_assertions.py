    Not for reading: this exists so one poll's value can be told from the next's.  JSON was tried first
    and erases exactly what matters here, since `(1,)` and `[1]` both render as `[1]` and a mapping's
    keys all become strings.  A tag carries the container's type instead, and every part is written with
    its own length in front, so nothing a value prints can be read as this rendering's punctuation: a
    leaf whose repr is `[1,2]` used to render exactly as the list `[1, 2]` did.

    Dicts and sets are sorted by their rendered parts: they have no order to preserve, and two equal ones
    can still iterate differently, since a set built from `[0, 8]` and one built from `[8, 0]` collide
    into the same bucket in opposite orders.

    The boundary, since a rendering cannot reproduce `==`: two values that are equal and print
    differently, `1` against `1.0`, count as a change, and two that are unequal and print alike, a
    dataclass hiding a field from its own repr, count as one value.  A leaf carries no type tag of its
    own for the same reason, or a `str` subclass would differ from the string it equals.

    One case cannot be got right by any key of this shape, rather than being a choice made here:
    `OrderedDict([a, b]) == {a: ..., b: ...} == OrderedDict([b, a])` while the two `OrderedDict`s are
    unequal, so Python's own relation is not transitive there and nothing that digests one value at a

    the meaning.
