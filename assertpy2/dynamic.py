    """Dynamic assertions mixin.

    When testing attributes of an object (or the contents of a dict), the
    [`is_equal_to()`][assertpy2.base.BaseMixin.is_equal_to] assertion can be a bit verbose:

        fred = Person('Fred', 'Smith')

        assert_that(fred.first_name).is_equal_to('Fred')
        assert_that(fred.name).is_equal_to('Fred Smith')
        assert_that(fred.say_hello()).is_equal_to('Hello, Fred!')

    Instead, use dynamic assertions in the form of ``has_<name>()`` where ``<name>`` is the name of
    any attribute, property, or zero-argument method on the given object. Dynamic equality
    assertions test if actual is equal to expected using the ``==`` operator. Using dynamic
    assertions, we can rewrite the above example as:

        assert_that(fred).has_first_name('Fred')
        assert_that(fred).has_name('Fred Smith')
        assert_that(fred).has_say_hello('Hello, Fred!')

    Similarly, dynamic assertions also work on any *dict-like* object:

        fred = {
            'first_name': 'Fred',
            'last_name': 'Smith',
            'shoe_size': 12
        }

        assert_that(fred).has_first_name('Fred')
        assert_that(fred).has_last_name('Smith')
        assert_that(fred).has_shoe_size(12)
    """

    def __getattr__(self, attr: str) -> Any:
        """Asserts that val has attribute attr and that its value is equal to other via a dynamic
        assertion of the form ``has_<attr>()``.

        The return stays ``Any`` on purpose, and the reason is written down because the annotation looks
        like an oversight worth fixing.  Two unrelated things resolve through this hook: a ``has_``
        wrapper, which takes one argument and hands back the builder, and any name registered with
        `add_extension`, which takes and returns whatever it declares.  No single signature is true of
        both.  Pinning the argument list reported a correct zero-argument extension call as too few
        arguments, and pinning the return type reported a correct extension result as the wrong type
        where it was used.  Both were measured against mypy, pyright and ty.

        The narrower annotation also bought less than it looked like.  It could not catch an assertion
        chained onto a dynamic step, because that access resolves back through this same hook; the only
        thing it added was a verdict in assignment position, which is where it was wrong for extensions.
